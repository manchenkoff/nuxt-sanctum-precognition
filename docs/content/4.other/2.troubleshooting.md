## Expose Precognition headers for CORS

Since Laravel Precognition requires additional headers to be passed to the front-end application, 
make sure that you have configured `exposed_headers` in your `config/cors.php` on the Laravel side:

```php [config/cors.php]
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

return [
    'paths' => ['*'],
    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
    'allowed_origins' => ['http://your-nuxt-app.dev'],
    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],
    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
    'exposed_headers' => ['Precognition', 'Precognition-Success'], // required
    'max_age' => 0,
    'supports_credentials' => true,
];
```

## Other problems

If you experience any other problem related to the API requests, 
please refer to the official `nuxt-auth-sanctum` module 
documentation - [Nuxt - Laravel Sanctum](https://sanctum.manchenkoff.me/advanced/troubleshooting).

If nothing helps, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/manchenkoff/nuxt-sanctum-precognition/issues) 
on the GitHub repository.
