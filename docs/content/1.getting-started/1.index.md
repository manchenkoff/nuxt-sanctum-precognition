This module provides an easy way to incorporate the Laravel Precognition validation approach into your project 
and leverage all the benefits of our existing module - [nuxt-auth-sanctum](https://sanctum.manchenkoff.me/nuxt-auth-sanctum).

::note
Since the original implementation of `laravel-precognition` for Vue is using `axios`, 
we could not use it with `ofetch` and Nuxt.
::

## Key Features

This module includes a range of features designed to streamline broadcasting:

- **Sanctum**-based authentication
- Automatic handling of **Precognition** headers
- Seamless work with **Laravel validation** errorsa
- Easy to migrate from **Laravel Precognition** Vue package
- Compatible with **Nuxt UI** forms
- **TypeScript** support
- **Simple** configuration

We recommend looking at our [breeze-nuxt](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-nuxt) template that works flawlessly with 
[breeze-api](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-api) Laravel application with preconfigured Sanctum, Precognition and Echo modules.
